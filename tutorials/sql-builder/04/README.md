## b) Raw SQL

If none of the previous methods described are enough to express your query, you can
use Raw SQL - specifically `Query`, `QueryRow`, and `Exec`, which are provided by the
[SQLBuilder][1] interface and mimic their counterparts in the `database/sql` API:

```go
rows, err := sess.Query(`SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM authors WHERE last_name = ?`, "Poe")
...

row, err := sess.QueryRow(`SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = ?`, 23)
...
```

Using raw SQL does not mean you'll have to map Go fields manually. You can import the
`upper.io/db.v3/lib/sqlbuilder` package and use the `sqlbuilder.NewIterator` function
so mapping is easier:

```go
iter := sqlbuilder.NewIterator(rows)

var books []Book
err := iter.All(&books)
```

This iterator provides well-known upper-db methods like `One`, `All`, and
`Next`.
