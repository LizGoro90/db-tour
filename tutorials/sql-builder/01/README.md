## a) SQL Builder

All the adapters for SQL databases come with a handy builder that you
can use to compose queries, as defined [here](https://upper.io/db.v3/lib/sqlbuilder).

There are different [SQLBuilder][1] methods you can use to begin your query, for
instance `SelectFrom`:

```go
q := sess.SelectFrom("books")
```

`SelectFrom` returns a [Selector][2] and some `Selector` methods return `Selector` 
too, so you can chain method calls like this:

```go
q := sess.SelectFrom("books").
  Where("title LIKE ?", "P%")
```

or

```go
q := sess.SelectFrom("books")
q = q.Where("title LIKE ?", "P%")
```

Note that we're reassigning `q` in the last example. This is because queries
are immutable and methods do not affect the caller, like in the next case (where
`q` is not affected by `Where`):

```go
q := sess.SelectFrom("books")
p := q.Where("title LIKE ?", "P%").
  OrderBy("title")
```

You can use `All` or `One` to compile, execute, and map results into
a Go type:

```go
var books []Book
err := q.All(&books)
```

or

```go
var book Book
err := q.All(&book)
```

The `Selector` interface also features a special `Iterator` method to create 
an iterator and go through results one by one:

```go
iter := q.Iterator()

for iter.Next(&book) {
  // ...
}

if err := iter.Err(); err != nil {
  // ...
}

if err := iter.Close(); err != nil {
  // ...
}
```
